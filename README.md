ActiveStorage is an amazing addition to Rails 5.2, and as usual the team have made it fantastically simple to use... if you’re generating HTML server-side, that is. This component aims to make it just as easy to use from React.

ActiveStorageProvider handles the direct upload of a file to an ActiveStorage service and the attachment of that file to your model. It uses the render props pattern so you can build your own upload widget.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-activestorage-provider
```

## Usage

ActiveStorageProvider makes it easy to add a simple upload button. When you call `handleUpload` with a `FileList` or an array of `File`s, this component creates a `Blob` record, uploads the file directly to your storage service, and then hits your Rails controller to attach the blob to your model. (If you want to handle the attachment yourself, [see below](#directuploadprovider).)

```jsx
import ActiveStorageProvider from 'react-activestorage-provider'

// ...

return (
  <ActiveStorageProvider
    endpoint={{
      path: '/profile',
      model: 'User',
      attribute: 'avatar',
      method: 'PUT',
    }}
    onSubmit={user => this.setState({ avatar: user.avatar })}
    render={({ handleUpload, uploads, ready }) => (
      <div>
        <input
          type="file"
          disabled={!ready}
          onChange={e => handleUpload(e.currentTarget.files)}
        />

        {uploads.map(upload => {
          switch (upload.state) {
            case 'waiting':
              return <p key={upload.id}>Waiting to upload {upload.file.name}</p>
            case 'uploading':
              return (
                <p key={upload.id}>
                  Uploading {upload.file.name}: {upload.progress}%
                </p>
              )
            case 'error':
              return (
                <p key={upload.id}>
                  Error uploading {upload.file.name}: {upload.error}
                </p>
              )
            case 'finished':
              return (
                <p key={upload.id}>Finished uploading {upload.file.name}</p>
              )
          }
        })}
      </div>
    )}
  />
)
```

### `ActiveStorageProvider` Props

| `endpoint`\*             | `{ path: string, model: string, attribute: string, method: string, host?: string, port?: string, protocol?: string }`<br />The details for the request to attach the file |
| `headers`                | `{[key: string]: string}`<br/>Optional headers to add to request, can also be used to override default headers                                                            |
| `multiple`               | `boolean` (false)<br/>Whether the component should accept multiple files. If true, the model should use `has_many_attached`                                               |
| `onBeforeBlobRequest`    | `({ id: string, file: File, xhr: XMLHttpRequest }) => mixed`<br />A callback that allows you to modify the blob request                                                   |
| `onBeforeStorageRequest` | `({ id: string, file: File, xhr: XMLHttpRequest }) => mixed`<br />A callback that allows you to modify the storage request                                                |

| `onSubmit`\*             | `Object => mixed`<br />A callback for the server response to successfully saving your model                                                                               |
| `render`\*               | `RenderProps => React.Node`<br />Render props                                                                                                                             |

### `RenderProps`

This is the type of the argument with which your render function will be called.

```jsx
export type RenderProps = {
  ready: boolean /* false while any file is uploading */,
  uploads: ActiveStorageFileUpload[] /* uploads in progress */,

  handleUpload: (FileList | File[]) => mixed /* call to initiate an upload */,

  /* or, if you want more granular control... */

  /* call to set list of files to be uploaded */
  handleChooseFiles: (FileList | File[]) => mixed,
  /* then call to begin the upload of the files in the list */
  handleBeginUpload: () => mixed,
}

type ActiveStorageFileUpload =
  | { state: 'waiting', id: string, file: File }
  | { state: 'uploading', id: string, file: File, progress: number }
  | { state: 'error', id: string, file: File, error: string }
  | { state: 'finished', id: string, file: File }
```

## `DirectUploadProvider`

ActiveStorageProvider makes it simple to add a quick “upload” button by taking care of both uploading and attaching your file, but it shouldn’t stand in your way if you’re doing something more interesting. If you want to handle the second step, attaching your `Blob` record to your model, yourself, you can use the lower level `DirectUploadProvider`. It creates the blob records and uploads the user’s files directly to your storage service, then calls you back with the signed ids of those blobs.

`DirectUploadProvider` is a named export, so

```jsx
import { DirectUploadProvider } from 'react-activestorage-provider'
```

and use it with the following props:

| Prop (\*required)        | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `directUploadsPath`      | `string`<br />The direct uploads path on your Rails app, if you’ve overridden `ActiveStorage::DirectUploadsController`                  |
| `headers`                | `{[key: string]: string}`<br/>Optional headers to add to request                                                                        |
| `multiple`               | `boolean`<br/>Whether the component should accept multiple files. If true, the model should use `has_many_attached`                     |
| `onBeforeBlobRequest`    | `({ id: string, file: File, xhr: XMLHttpRequest }) => mixed`<br />A callback that allows you to modify the blob request                 |
| `onBeforeStorageRequest` | `({ id: string, file: File, xhr: XMLHttpRequest }) => mixed`<br />A callback that allows you to modify the storage request              |
| `onSuccess`\*            | `(string[]) => mixed`<br />The callback that will be called with the signed ids of the files after the upload is complete               |
| `origin`                 | `{ host?: string, port?: string, protocol?: string }`<br />The origin of your rails server. Defaults to where your React app is running |
| `render`\*               | `RenderProps => React.Node`<br />Render props                                                                                           |
