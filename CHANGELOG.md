## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Allows host to be configured, since some apps host their front-end on a different server than their API. Thanks, @derigible

## [0.0.3] — 2018-02-12

### Changed

* Exports flow types so you can import them

## [0.0.2] — 2018-02-09

### Changed

* Parses the server response as JSON automatically and calls `onSubmit` with the contents of the response body
* Uses `Accept: 'application/json'` so you don’t need to end `endpoint.path` with `.json`

## 0.0.1 — 2018-02-09

### Added

* A component that handles the direct upload of a file to an ActiveStorage service and calls render props with arguments that let you build your own upload widget.
