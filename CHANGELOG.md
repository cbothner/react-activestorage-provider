# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- ActiveStorageProvider now passes custom headers down to the DirectUploadProvider it uses. This change is to better support users who customize their DirectUploadsController, in response to [this conversation](https://github.com/cbothner/react-activestorage-provider/issues/22).
- ActiveStorageProvider accepts the `directUploadsPath` so users who have customized their DirectUploadsController don’t need to use DirectUploadProvider directly.

## [0.7.0] — 2019-01-03

### Changed

- Removed error when CSRF meta tag does not exist. Thanks, @SampsonCrowley

## [0.6.0] — 2018-10-23

### Added

- Added an optional `headers` prop so that custom headers can be passed. Thanks, @kceb

### Changed

- If `X-CSRF-Token` is included in the `headers` prop, we are no longer fetching the CSRF token from the meta tags.

### Removed

- Removed the special-case `token` prop in favor of the more general `headers` prop, to which you can pass the Authorization header. You can replace `token="Bearer asdf"` with `headers={{ Authorization: 'Bearer asdf' }}`

## [0.5.0] — 2018-10-19

### Added

- Exposed a lower level component `DirectUploadProvider` that creates a `Blob` record and uploads the file, then returns the attachment IDs for the consumer to attach.
- Allows choosing files and beginning their upload to be two separate processes by adding two more callbacks to RenderProps.

## [0.4.0] — 2018-10-12

### Added

- Accepts an `onError` callback prop. If saving the model returns an error status code, such as from failed validations, we need to be able to alert the user.

## [0.3.0] — 2018-08-06

### Added

- Added a `token` prop so that a JWT for the Authorization header can be passed. Thanks, @MikeKotte

## [0.2.0] — 2018-06-26

### Changed

- `handleUpload` now takes `File[]` or `FileList` for greater flexibility.

## [0.1.1] — 2018-04-30

### Fixed

- Correctly send multiple blob ids for multiple attachments.

## [0.1.0] — 2018-04-27

### Added

- Allows host to be configured, since some apps host their front-end on a different server than their API. Thanks, @derigible

## [0.0.3] — 2018-02-12

### Changed

- Exports flow types so you can import them

## [0.0.2] — 2018-02-09

### Changed

- Parses the server response as JSON automatically and calls `onSubmit` with the contents of the response body
- Uses `Accept: 'application/json'` so you don’t need to end `endpoint.path` with `.json`

## 0.0.1 — 2018-02-09

### Added

- A component that handles the direct upload of a file to an ActiveStorage service and calls render props with arguments that let you build your own upload widget.
